# Task 6 - Password Strength Analysis:
# Overview:
This project aims to understand password strength by creating multiple passwords of varying complexity, testing their strength, and analyzing results to determine best password creation practices for enhanced security against cyberattacks like brute force and dictionary attacks.

# Objectives:
•	Explore factors influencing password strength.
•	Test passwords with different characteristics.
•	Analyze test results to identify strong password criteria.
•	Understand common password attack methods.
•	Recommend best practices for secure passwords.

# Methodology:
The following steps outline the approach used in this task:
1.	Create Passwords: Generate multiple passwords incorporating uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and varying lengths.
2.	Use Password Strength Tools: Test each password on free online password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com) to obtain score, complexity rating, and detailed feedback.
3.	Record Results: Document scores and observations about factors that enhance or reduce password strength.
4.	Research Attacks: Study common password attacks such as brute force and dictionary attacks to understand vulnerabilities.
5.	Analyze Findings: Correlate password characteristics with attack resistance and tool feedback.
6.	Summarize Best Practices: Compile tips and guidelines to create strong, secure passwords.
7.	Prepare Report: Draft a complete report with introduction, results, explanations, and conclusions.

# Files:
•	TASK-6-BY-AMRUTHA.pdf: Detailed project report.
•	Screenshots: Visual password strength test results highlighting scores and feedback.

# Key Concepts:
•	Password Strength: A measure of a password’s resistance to guessing and cracking attacks based on length, complexity, and unpredictability.
•	Brute Force Attack: An exhaustive automated method attempting all possible passwords.
•	Dictionary Attack: Uses a precompiled list of common passwords and words to guess passwords.
•	Best Practices: Use strong, unique passwords with a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and avoid predictable patterns.

# Conclusion:
Effective password creation significantly improves resistance against cyberattacks. This task demonstrates that length, complexity, and unpredictability are critical factors for strong passwords. Implementing these practices ensures better cybersecurity hygiene and protects user accounts from unauthorized access.
